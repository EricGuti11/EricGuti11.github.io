                        Hi, I'm Eric Gutierrez, a Computer Science graduate from Appalachian State University.
                        My academic focus was in web and software development, as well as systems programming.
                        This site is my personal space to showcase the projects I've built and the work I'm proud of.

                            Shattered Restraints is a 2D fighting game developed as part of my senior project, which I co-created with a partner. 
                            I contributed extensively to both the gameplay and visual design, including developing the character state machine, 
                            designing and implementing key UI elements, and creating original artwork for my custom character, the Swordsman.
